This python script generates a set of bingo cards in RTF format, from an RTF template file and a phrases file. (RTF is the Rich Text file format that can be edited in Microsoft Word or other editors.) Since I keep finding this periodically useful, I wanted to publish it in case others can use it.

Usage:

    python3 bingo_cards.py templateFile phrasesFile numCards

To run it with the samples included, as-is, try this:

    python3 bingo_cards.py template.rtf phrases.txt 30

See the example output folder for examples.

Modify template.rtf file to your liking. I recommend using MS Word to edit it.

Modify the phrases.txt file for the phrases you want for the bingo squares.

Please contribute your phrases collections to the repo, as new phrases text files!
